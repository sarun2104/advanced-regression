# Advanced Regression using Ridge and Lasso	
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
> The company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  - How well those variables describe the price of a house.
  - Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
- To ensure model is robust and generalisable, one need to ensure that the model work the best on both the train and test data. 
- The model should have a low bias and low variance, hence achieving bias vs variance tradeoff. Model should be trained using cross validation. 
- Using a regularisation method like lasso and ridge can help reduce the instances of overfitting. 
- Appropriate parameters in the model should be fine-tuned using accurate hyper-parameter tuning steps.
